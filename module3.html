        <h2 class="topic">Chicken</h2>
       <p class="content text-justify p-4"> The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red
        junglefowl, originally from India. They have also partially hybridized with other
        wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green 
        junglefowl). Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger
        male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An 
        adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a
        pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both 
        their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for
        cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated
         for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.

        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
         population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011.
          There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous 
          cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in
           language and literature.

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia,
         Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the 
        Middle East, and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India
        , the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in 
        the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from
         the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose 
         III. They are known in ancient Greece from the 5th century BC.

        <h2 class="text-center text-justify p-4">Beef</h2>
        <p class="contant">
            Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus).

            In prehistoric times, humankind hunted aurochs and later domesticated them.
            Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for
            the quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third most widel
            y consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the Unite
            d States, Brazil, and China were the largest producers of beef.
            Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can
            be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or
            minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and 
            vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is
            associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart
            disease, especially when processed. Beef has a high environmental impact,
            being a primary driver of deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas
            emissions of any agricultural product.


            The word beef is from the Latin word bōs,in contrast to cow which is from
            Middle English cou (both words have the same Indo-European root *gʷou-).
            After the Norman Conquest, the French-speaking nobles who ruled England
            naturally used French words to refer to the meats they were served.
            Thus, various Anglo-Saxon words were used for the animal (such as nēat,
            or cu for adult females) by the peasants, but the meat was called boef
            (ox) (Modern French bœuf) by the French nobles — who did not often deal
            with the live animal — when it was served to them. This is one example 
            of the common English dichotomy between the words for animals (with
            largely Germanic origins) and their meat (with Romanic origins) that 
            is also found in such English word-pairs as pig/pork, deer/venison,
            sheep/mutton and chicken/poultry (also the less common goat/chevon)
            .[ Beef is cognate with bovine through the Late Latin bovīnus. 
             The rarely used plural form of beef is beeves.

        <h2 class="text-center text-justify p-4">Sushi</h2>
        <P class="content">
            Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish 
            of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and 
            salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients (ねた, neta), such as 
            seafood—often raw—and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary 
            widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as 
            shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1]

            The inventor of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented 
            nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi most known today, in which seafood is placed 
            on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period (1603–1867)
            . It was the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.

            Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be
            
            prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with
            
            seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat
            . Many types of sushi are vegetarian. 
            
            President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Sukiyabashi Jiro
            A dish known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司, "matured fish"), stored in
             fermented rice for possibly months at a time, has been cited as one
             of the early influences for the Japanese practice of applying rice 
             on raw fish. The fish was fermented with rice vinegar, salt, and rice, 
            after which the rice was discarded Narezushi is also called honnare,
            meaning "fully fermented," as opposed to namanare, meaning "partially
            fermented", a type of sushi that appeared in the Muromachi period.

            Narezushi originated in Southeast Asia where it was made to preserve
             freshwater fish, possibly in the Mekong River basin, which is now Laos,
            Cambodia, and Thailand, and in the Irrawaddy River basin, which is now 
            Myanmar. The first mention of a narezushi-like food is in a Chinese
            dictionary thought to be from the 4th Century, in this instance referring 
            to salted fish that had been placed in cooked or steamed rice, which
            caused it to undergo a fermentation process via lactic acid.
            Fermentation methods following similar logic in other Asian rice 
            cultures include burong isda, balao-balao, and tinapayan of the
            Philippines; pla ra (ปลาร้า) of Thailand; and sikhae (식해) 
            of Korea.
            The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevents the fish from spoiling. When 
            wet-field rice cultivation was introduced during the Yayoi period, lakes 
            and rivers would flood during the rainy season, and fish would get caught
             in the rice paddy fields. Pickling was a way to preserve the excess fish 
             and guarantee food for the following months, and narezushi became an 
             important source of protein for Japanese consumers. The term sushi 
            literally means "sour-tasting", as the overall dish has a sour and umami
            or savory taste. The term comes from an antiquated し shi terminal-form 
            conjugation, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb sui
            (酸い, "to be sour"),resulting in the term sushi (酸し). Narezushi   
            still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga
            Prefecture.

            In the Yōrō Code (養老律令, Yōrō-ritsuryō) of 718, the characters for "鮨" and 
            "鮓" are written as a tribute to the Japanese imperial court, and although
             there are various 
            theories as to what exactly this food was, it is possible that it referred
             to narezushi.
