            <p class="content">The chicken is a domesticated red junglefowl species that is 
                originally from India. They have also partially hybridized with other wild 
                species of junglefowl. Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and 
                a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a 
                capon

            <p class="content">Beef refers to the meat that comes from the cattle animal. While
                 beef offers many cuts, the meat is commonly enjoyed in the form of steak, ground
                  meat (hamburger), or long-cooking roasts. Beef is an excellent source of protein
                  , as well as zinc, iron, and B vitamins.

                Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt,
                 accompanied by a variety of ingredients, such as seafood—often raw—and vegetables.
                  Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is
                   "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.
