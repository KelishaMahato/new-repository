<h1>Let's Learn bout Food:</h1>
<h4>
  Food is one of the basic necessities of life. Food contains nutrients—substances essential
  for the growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues and for the regulation of vital 
  processes. Nutrients provide the energy our bodies need to function.
The energy in food is measured in units called calories. 
Age, sex, weight, height, and level of activity determine the number of calories a person
 needs each day. Depending on age, sex, and activity level, the recommended daily caloric
 intake for a child aged 11 to 14 can range anywhere from 1,600 to 2,600 calories per
 day, with sedentary girls needing the fewest calories and active boys needing the most.
 For adults, this can range from 1,800 to about 3,000.
<br>
Kinds of Nutrients:<br>

Scientists divide nutrients into six major groups: carbohydrates, fats, proteins,
minerals, vitamins, and water. Most foods contain all or most nutrient groups, in 
different amounts.
<br>
Carbohydrates provide energy for the body. Nearly all the carbohydrates we eat come from
plants. They include starches found in cereal grains and plants like potatoes and yams.
Sugars, found in fruits, vegetables, and milk, are also carbohydrates. Sugarcane and 
sugar beets are grown specifically for their high sugar content.
<br>
Many of the starches and sugars we eat have been processed into products, such as flour 
and corn syrup. These processed carbohydrates are used in cookies, cakes, breads, pastas,
and pies.
<br>
Fats provide more than twice as much energy as carbohydrates. They also help protect and
insulate the body and its internal organs. Common fats include vegetable oils, such as 
soybean, cottonseed, and corn oil. They are used in cooking and in the processing of many
foods. Fats that come from animal products include butter and lard. Eggs, milk, cheese,
meats, poultry, and fish also contain high levels of fats.
<br>
Proteins are the body’s chief tissue-builders. They help keep skin, bones, muscles, and 
blood healthy. Proteins also help regulate bodily processes, including transporting oxygen
 and nutrients into and out of cells; the clotting of blood; and the formation of 
 antibodies, which help fight disease. Animal products, such as beef, fish, poultry,
  eggs, and dairy products, are high in protein. Grains, nuts, and some beans are also
 protein-rich foods.
<br>
Minerals and vitamins are called micronutrients because they are needed in very small 
quantities compared with carbohydrates, fats, and proteins (known as macronutrients). 
Minerals provide building materials for the body and help regulate its activities, much 
as proteins do. Calcium and phosphorus build strong bones and teeth, iron contributes to
 healthy blood, and iodine helps keep the thyroid gland working.
<br>
Vitamins help the body make full use of other nutrients by assisting the chemical 
reactions that make those nutrients work. For example, vitamin B1, or thiamine, helps 
regulate the release of energy from carbohydrates, promotes a healthy appetite, and aids
the functioning of the nervous system. Vitamin D helps in the growth and maintenance of
healthy bones.
<br>
Other essentials for the body’s health include water, oxygen, and fiber. Some scientists 
include water in the list of basic nutrients. Water makes up more than half of a human 
body’s weight. It is involved in most body processes, such as the regulation of t
emperature, the transporting of nutrients into cells, and the elimination of waste 
products from cells.
<br>
Oxygen is not a nutrient, since it is breathed in and not eaten, but it is essential to 
life. It permits the release of energy from food inside the body.
<br>
Fiber is indigestible material found in most plant foods. It adds bulk to the diet,
 helping to keep the intestines healthy. Fiber-rich foods include whole grains, dried
  beans, and fresh fruits and vegetables.
<br>
A healthy diet contains a balanced mix of different foods that together provide all 
essential nutrients. Malnutrition is the lack of a balanced diet. Too few nutrients,
 too many nutrients, or an imbalance of nutrients (too many carbohydrates, for instance,
  and not enough fruits and vegetables) can lead to malnutrition.
<br>
Undernutrition is a form of malnutrition. It is usually linked to hunger. 
Undernutrition happens when the body does not get enough food to meet its needs. 
Many diseases and even death are caused by lack of food. Death due to lack of food 
is called starvation.
<br>
To get the right amounts of nutrients, people need to select from a range of food types: 
cereal grains; fruits and vegetables; legumes, meat, poultry, fish, and eggs; and milk 
and dairy products. A food pyramid outlines the suggested amount of these different types
 of foods people should eat each day.
<br>
<br>
Cereal Grains
<br>

Cereal grains are the edible seeds of certain grasses. People have grown them since the 
beginning of agriculture. Today, the most commonly grown grains are wheat, rice, and corn 
(maize). Other important grains are sorghum, millet, barley, oats, and rye.

Worldwide, cereal grains are the most important food staples. They are eaten almost daily
 by large populations. They supply a significant percentage of the calories consumed by 
 the world’s population. Cereal grains and the products made from them provide food not 
 only for people, but also for livestock, such as cattle, chickens, and hogs.

Throughout the world, more wheat is planted than any other grain. Wheat is the chief 
ingredient in most breads, cookies, cakes, crackers, pastas, and some breakfast cereals. C
hina, the United States, Russia, Ukraine, India, France, and Canada are major 
wheat-producing countries. Wheat, often eaten as bread, serves as the principal food 
grain for people living in regions with temperate climates.
<br>
<br>
Rice, an Asian tropical grass, is a food staple for more than half the world’s population.
 More than 90 percent of the world’s total rice crop is produced and eaten in South 
 and East Asia. Rice is also a food staple for people in parts of Africa and Latin 
 America. This cereal grain thrives in a warm, humid climate with heavy rainfall or wet 
 ground. It is often grown in flooded fields called rice paddies.
<br>
Hominy grits, corn bread, popcorn, and tortillas are all made with corn. Outside the 
United States, this grain is called maize. Although native to the Americas, maize is now 
cultivated throughout most of the world and is a staple food in many areas. It grows in 
various soils and climates and at different elevations. American farmers produce over 30 
percent of the world’s corn; of that 40 percent, most of it is used to feed livestock. 
Corn is also used to produce sweeteners, such as corn syrup and cornstarch.
<br>
Sorghum and millet are other grains commonly used as livestock feeds. These grains are 
also staple foods for people in parts of Africa and Asia, where they are used in breads, 
porridges, and cakes.
<br>
Three other grains—barley, oats, and rye—are important in many regions. Barley thrives 
in a wide range of climates. One type of barley is the source of malt for making beer. 
Barley is also used in making vinegar, malt extract, and beverages similar to milk. 
Pearl barley, the most popular form of this grain, is often used in soups and other
 foods.

Oats and rye were domesticated much later than other grains. Oats are used mainly as 
livestock feed, but also go into oatmeal and other breakfast cereals. After wheat, rye 
is the second most common grain used as a bread flour; the two are often mixed together
 in breads. Bread made with rye alone, called black bread, is popular in many European 
 countries.
<br>
<br>
 Fruits and Vegetables
<br>
The term “fruit” has several meanings. To a botanist, it means the part of a plant that 
contains seeds. According to this definition, fruits include most nuts, as well as
 vegetables, such as cucumbers and tomatoes.

To most of us, though, “fruit” is defined as the soft, edible, seed-bearing part 
of a perennial plant. A perennial is a plant that lives for more than one growing 
season. Fresh fruits are rich in carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and fiber. 
They can be preserved by freezing, canning, or drying.
<br>
Different fruits grow in different climates, and may not grow well in climates that are 
too cold, hot, dry, or wet. Based on the kind of climate in which they grow, fruits can 
be classified in different groups: temperate fruits, subtropical fruits, and tropical 
fruits.
<br>
Temperate fruits grow best where there is a well-defined cold season, as in the U.S. 

states of Washington and Oregon. Temperate fruits include apples, berries, grapes, pears
, plums, and peaches.

Subtropical fruits thrive where temperatures are mostly warm year-round. The area arou
nd the Mediterranean Sea has a subtropical climate. Citrus fruits, such as lemons, or
anges, grapefruits, dates, pomegranates, and some types of avocadoes, are subtropical 
fr
uits.
<br>
Tropical fruits require a hot climate to grow. Tropical fruits, such as bananas, mangoe
s, and papayas, grow in hot, humid areas like the Philippines.

Vegetables are the edible parts of herbaceous plants. Herbaceous plants, sometimes j
ust c
alled herbs, have stems that are softer and less woody than those of trees and shr
ubs. Ve

getables are good sources of fiber, minerals, and vitamins. Most vegetables are ann
uals, l
iving for only one growing season.
<br>
Vegetables can be roots, leaves, stems, seeds, or bulbs. For example, carrots, radis
hes
, and beets are roots. Cabbage, celery, lettuce, and spinach are leaves or leafstalks. H
eads of broccoli are flower stalks topped by thick clusters of flower buds. Asparagus is a
 stem. Cucumbers, eggplants, and tomatoes contain the seeds of the plant. Garlic, leeks, and onions are bulbs.

Some plants, called tubers, have a special type of underground stem that can be eaten fr
esh as a vegetable or used as an ingredient in other dishes. In temperate regions, the most important tuber is the potato. The potato was first a food staple to indigenous cultures of the Andes of South America. Today, major potato-growing countries include Russia, China, and Poland.

Important tropical tubers include yams, cassavas, and taros. These tubers are staple foods in many cultures. For instance, taro is a major food crop of the islands of Polynesia, as well as West Africa. Cassava is a staple food for more than 500 million people in Africa and Latin America.

Legumes, Meat, Poultry, Fish, and Eggs

Legumes are plants that are raised for their edible seeds or seed pods. Peas, lima beans
, soybeans, peanuts, and lentils are all legumes. Legumes that are harvested for their dr
y seeds, such as beans or lentils, are called pulses. Pulses are food staples in India an
d Pakistan.

Legumes and pulses contain high amounts of protein. In addition, they supply iron, other 
minerals, and vitamins.

The term “meat” usually refers to the edible flesh of mammals, such as cattle, pigs, and 
sheep. Meat is a high-protein food and is rich in other nutrients, as well.
<br>

The United States, Australia, Russia, and Argentina raise much of the world’s beef c
attle. Beef can come from cows, bulls, or steers. Cows are adult female cattle. Bulls a
re adult male cattle capable of reproduction. Steers are adult male cattle that have been
 castrated, or been made incapable of reproduction. Meat from very young cattle, or calve
 s, is called veal.
